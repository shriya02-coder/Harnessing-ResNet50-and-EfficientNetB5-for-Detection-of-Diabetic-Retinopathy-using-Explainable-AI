# Harnessing-ResNet50-and-EfficientNetB5-for-Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-Explainable-AI
Explores the use of advanced DL models and explainable AI techniques for accurate and interpretable detection of diabetic retinopathy stages in retinal images.

## Abstract
Diabetic retinopathy, a significant complication of diabetes, is known for its capacity to severely impair vision, and in severe cases, it can lead to blindness if not detected and addressed at early stages. The prevailing diagnostic practices, which involve the meticulous manual examination of fundus images, are notably labor-intensive and time-consuming. This research introduces a groundbreaking method that integrates advanced deep learning architectures, namely ResNet50 and EfficientNetB5, with cutting-edge Explainable AI techniques, including the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) methodology. This integration not only elevates the precision in identifying the stages of diabetic retinopathy but also substantially augments the transparency and understanding of the AI-driven diagnostic process. Such an approach ensures a more accurate, fair, and transparent detection of the condition, substantially improving the outcomes of diabetic retinopathy identification. The implementation of this method stands to revolutionize the diagnostic landscape, bolstering confidence in AI applications in medical diagnostics and empowering healthcare professionals with robust, informed decision-making tools.

## Introduction
Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a frequent complication of diabetes, causes retinal lesions that impair vision and can lead to blindness due to elevated glucose levels, which contribute to vascular damage in the retina. The development of DR is a structured sequence of four distinct stages: 

1. Mild Nonproliferative Retinopathy, characterized by micro-aneurysms.
2. Moderate Nonproliferative Retinopathy, where blood vessels deform and swell, impairing efficient blood transport.
3. Severe Nonproliferative Retinopathy, marked by a significant increase in blood vessel blockages, reducing blood flow to the retina and triggering the formation of new blood vessels.
4. Proliferative DR, the final stage, where the retina secretes growth stimulants, leading to the proliferation of new vessels that may invade the vitreous gel within the eye.

Early detection of each stage is crucial to prevent vision deterioration. Currently, diagnosis relies on manual examination of fundus images by medical professionals, a method that is labor-intensive and occasionally imprecise.

To enhance detection, this paper focuses on the use of ResNet50 and EfficientNetB5, two neural network architectures, which are part of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) family. These deep learning models efficiently analyze fundus images to detect DR stages more rapidly and accurately than traditional methods. However, they often lack transparency in their decision-making process. This issue is addressed using the SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) method, an Explainable AI tool that quantifies and visualizes the impact of features through heatmaps, thereby enhancing interpretability. This approach helps professionals understand the classifications made by these models and assists in planning accurate therapeutic strategies. Explainable AI, particularly through SHAP, is crucial for assessing model outputs in terms of accuracy, fairness, transparency, and outcomes, ultimately leading to improved trust and effectiveness in DR detection.
